# fcc-again

- recursion thought process should be written and analyzed
- regex was good but didn't try to memorize rules and checked a few solutions
- Basic Data Structures section I did long ago, so did again for warm up with my second account

- longest word in a string caused some time consumption, separating by space I had to count the word length, but as the code was depended on space, the last word length counting was causing issue, the missing piece, so while counting the characters and increasing value, additonal check was added inside the "if" block "if the string position is the last one or not"
