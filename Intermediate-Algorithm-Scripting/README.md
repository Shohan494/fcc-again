## Sum All Numbers in a Range
- this problem must have a loop, but before that my thought was to find the loop start and end 
## Diff Two Arrays
- here two arrays so compared both with both and picked not matched ones and then concat both results
## Seek And Destroy
- Object.values(arguments) is new to me
- const valsToRemove = Object.values(arguments).slice(1);
## wherefore-art-thou
- the thinking process was accurate but due to less used to in js code the problem got me, **need to practice more about return function js filter and inside filter function or any js function we can write inner code block and also return**
## Smallest Common Multiple
- for this solution, I picked the largest number then incremented, then checked with all other numbers in range if divisible. if divisible by all other numbers, then that's the one number which is the smallest common multiple
## Steam Roller
- **Recursion and Spread Operator in Javascript**

## Arguments Optional
- **how a function can call or return which expects another parameter?**
