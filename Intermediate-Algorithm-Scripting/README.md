## Sum All Numbers in a Range
- this problem must have a loop, but before that my thought was to find the loop start and end 
## Diff Two Arrays
- here two arrays so compared both with both and picked not matched ones and then concat both results
## Seek And Destroy
- Object.values(arguments) is new to me
- const valsToRemove = Object.values(arguments).slice(1);
